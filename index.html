     <p>Hello World!</p>
     <p>My name is <b>Maayan Kim</b> and I am an HR professional, currently exploring the blockchain/crypto space.</p>
     <p><i>My background in a nutshell:</i>
       <ul>
        <li>Born in Israel, reside in South Korea since 2013</li>
        <li>Started my career as a recruiter, had experience running my own company, and currently working as an HR manager at a blockchain company</li>
        <li>Passionate about decentralization and transparency</li>
        <li>Exploring more about coding, currently learning and practicing HTML/CSS</li>
       </ul>
     </p>
     <p><i>My journey at stakefish</i>
      <p>first things first, <b>stakefish</b> is a staking provider for Proof of Stake based blockchain projects. 
      </p>I started working at stakefish in late 2019, and while entering a blockchain company, I started my own personal journey in the blockchain/crypto space.
      </br> I got to be exposed to the different projects and activities in the space. I especially related and dove deeper into a project called Solana and the NFT world (although I am not a designer). Understanding more about blockchain, both the technology and the philosophy behind it, had a big part in my will to understand better development and development logic.
      </p> The values that most resonate with me are transparency, decentralization, and financial literacy, and I try to reflect those values both in my career as well as my personal life. For example, I am a big believer in communicating clearly and match expectations as part of being transparent. It can be at work, or with friends and family.
      </p> While working here, and in the past couple of years I had the opportunity to be exposed to remote work and experience the advantages and challenges of being part of and operating a remote-first company.
      <br/> I got to meet and work with people from across the world. I got to be exposed to varied cultures, perspectives, and ways of communication. And with that also understand the importance of collaborative and inclusive communication. 
     <p><i>My journey at Abroadviser</i>
      <p>I started my own company for different reasons, but mainly it grew from a mix of my challenges when I moved my life to a different country (South Korea) and the understanding that many like me have similar challenges as well.
      </br>I noticed that I am indeed bringing value to fellow newcomers by sharing my experience and also sharing information.
      </br> Seeing the impact it created around people I knew, I decided to start my own company and try my hand in growing a startup.
      <p> There were many lessons I have learned, from both business and operational perspective. And I believe this experience was precious in growing myself professionally and personally.
      </br> I learned more about the importance of teamwork and adaptability among other things. Although my startup did not really take off as I hoped for, I could experience and be exposed to challenges I did not have before.
