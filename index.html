        <h4>My journey at stakefish</h4>
        <p> First things first, <a href="https://stake.fish" target="_blank">stakefish</a> is a staking provider for Proof of Stake based blockchain projects. 
        </p> I was working at stakefish from late 2019 until early 2022. It was my first company in the blockchain industry, and with work, I also started my personal journey in the blockchain/crypto space as well.
        </br> I got to be exposed to the different projects and activities in the space. I especially related and dove deeper into a project called Solana and the NFT world. Understanding more about blockchain, both the technology and the philosophy behind it, had a big part in my will to understand better development and development logic.
        </p> The values that most resonate with me are transparency, decentralization, and financial literacy, and I try to reflect those values both in my career as well as my personal life. For example, I am a big believer in communicating clearly and matching expectations as part of being transparent. It can be at work, or with friends and family.
        </p> While working at stakefish for a couple of years, I also had the opportunity to be exposed to remote work and experience the advantages and challenges of being part of and operating in a remote-first company.
        <br/> I got to meet and work with people from across the world. I got to be exposed to varied cultures, perspectives, and ways of communication. And with that, also understand the importance of collaborative and inclusive communication. 
      <p>
        <h4>My journey at Abroadviser:</h4>
        <p> I started my own company, <a href="https://abroadviser.github.io/" target="_blank">Abroadviser</a>, for different reasons, but mainly it grew out of my challenges when I moved my life to a different country (South Korea) and the understanding that many like me might have experienced similar challenges.
        </br> I noticed that I am indeed bringing value to fellow newcomers by sharing my experiences and reliable information.
        </br> Seeing the impact it created around people I knew, I decided to start my own company and try my hand at growing a startup.
        <p> There were many lessons I have learned, from both business and operational perspectives. And I believe this experience was precious in growing myself professionally and personally.
        </br> I learned more about the importance of teamwork and adaptability among other things. Although my startup did not take off as I hoped it would, I could experience and be exposed to challenges I did not have before.

        I coded this website by myself as part of my HTML and CSS self-learning, which I started to better understand coding logic and developers in general.
